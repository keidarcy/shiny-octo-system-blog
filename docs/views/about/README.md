What bring you here❓🤔

I was born and grew up in mainland China till going for learning Japanese in Kyoto since 2015. Then I finished Masters Degrees in Economics at Hitotusbashi University in Tokyo from April 2017 to March 2019.

However, I became a software developer in Tokyo since April 2019.

Even though I don't have any Computer Science background, I'm curious about anything in this area, try to learn anything I can, watch Youtube tutorials, read basic Linux book, learn many programming courses, read technoloy posts, try to blogging, take responsibility in job, to everything I can to push myself grow fast.

I understand that I stil have endless staffs to learn, just do it :).

I will try to keep writing [posts](/) here, keep recording something.

你好鸭！ 我从日本的一桥大学经济学硕士毕业以后在东京选了开发者当我的职业。

虽然我没有计算机相关的背景。但我对整个行业充满了好奇，从我入行以来尽可能的通过各种手段吸收计算机或网络相关的知识。

希望我可以把这个[博客](/)坚持下去，记录一些自己的经历吧。

こんにちは！

けいです。2015 年に中国から京都で日本語を勉強。2017 年に一橋大学経済学研究科に入学、2019 年に修了。

その後、IT エンジニアになって、猛勉強した 😂 好きなことだから、大変と思わないかも。

時間あれば、この[ブログ](/)と[Qiita](https://qiita.com/xyyolab)を並行で更新したい！

I built a blog with Laravel and Vue [before](), the building experience is good but hard to maintain there.
Hope I can keep update here😉
